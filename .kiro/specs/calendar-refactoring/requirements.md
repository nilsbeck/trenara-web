# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current calendar component in the Trenara training application has grown into a monolithic 300+ line component that handles multiple responsibilities including state management, data fetching, UI rendering, and business logic. The component violates single responsibility principles and makes extensive use of complex derived state calculations, making it difficult to maintain, test, and extend. This refactoring initiative aims to decompose the calendar into a well-structured, modular architecture using Svelte 5 patterns while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the calendar component decomposed into focused, single-responsibility components, so that I can maintain and extend individual features without affecting the entire system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the calendar is refactored THEN the main calendar component SHALL be under 100 lines and delegate specific responsibilities to child components
2. WHEN a developer needs to modify date selection logic THEN they SHALL work only on a dedicated DateSelector component
3. WHEN a developer needs to modify training display logic THEN they SHALL work only on dedicated detail components
4. WHEN navigation functionality needs changes THEN they SHALL work only on a dedicated CalendarNavigation component

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized state management using Svelte 5 runes, so that calendar state is predictable and components can reactively update without complex prop drilling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calendar state changes occur THEN they SHALL be managed through a dedicated calendar store using Svelte 5 runes
2. WHEN multiple components need calendar data THEN they SHALL access it through reactive state subscriptions
3. WHEN debugging state issues THEN the state flow SHALL be traceable through a single source of truth
4. WHEN derived state calculations are needed THEN they SHALL use Svelte 5 $derived runes for optimal reactivity

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the complex date calculation logic extracted into dedicated utilities, so that it can be tested independently and reused across components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN date offset calculations are needed THEN they SHALL be handled by pure utility functions
2. WHEN date formatting is required THEN it SHALL use dedicated formatting utilities
3. WHEN date validation occurs THEN it SHALL use centralized validation functions
4. WHEN calendar grid generation is needed THEN it SHALL use a dedicated calendar math utility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the data fetching logic separated from UI components, so that API interactions can be tested and cached independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calendar data is needed THEN it SHALL be fetched through dedicated service functions
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the service layer SHALL handle retries and error states
3. WHEN data caching is required THEN it SHALL be managed at the service level
4. WHEN multiple components need the same data THEN they SHALL share it through the service layer

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tab management logic extracted into a reusable component, so that the complex conditional rendering can be simplified and tested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tab switching occurs THEN it SHALL be handled by a dedicated TabManager component
2. WHEN tab visibility logic is needed THEN it SHALL be encapsulated in the tab component
3. WHEN new tabs are added THEN they SHALL integrate through a consistent tab interface
4. WHEN tab content needs to be rendered THEN it SHALL use slot-based composition

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the training data filtering logic componentized, so that complex data transformations are isolated and testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training data needs filtering by date THEN it SHALL use dedicated filter components
2. WHEN different training types need different filtering THEN each SHALL have its own filter logic
3. WHEN filter logic changes THEN it SHALL not affect other calendar functionality
4. WHEN new training types are added THEN they SHALL integrate through existing filter interfaces

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error boundaries and loading states, so that the calendar gracefully handles failures and provides good user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are in progress THEN the calendar SHALL show appropriate loading indicators
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the calendar SHALL display user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN partial data loads THEN the calendar SHALL render available data and indicate missing portions
4. WHEN network connectivity is restored THEN the calendar SHALL automatically retry failed requests

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all calendar data structures, so that type safety prevents runtime errors and improves developer experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calendar components are created THEN they SHALL use strict TypeScript interfaces for all props
2. WHEN API responses are processed THEN they SHALL be validated against TypeScript schemas
3. WHEN component events are emitted THEN they SHALL have strongly typed payloads
4. WHEN state updates occur THEN they SHALL be type-checked at compile time

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the calendar components to be unit testable, so that I can ensure reliability and prevent regressions during future changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calendar components are created THEN they SHALL be testable in isolation with mocked dependencies
2. WHEN user interactions occur THEN they SHALL be simulatable in unit tests
3. WHEN state changes happen THEN they SHALL be verifiable through automated tests
4. WHEN edge cases exist THEN they SHALL be covered by comprehensive test suites

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing calendar functionality preserved, so that my training workflow remains unchanged after the refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all current calendar features SHALL work identically to before
2. WHEN users navigate between months THEN the behavior SHALL be exactly the same
3. WHEN users select dates and view details THEN the information SHALL be displayed in the same format
4. WHEN users interact with training actions THEN all modals and operations SHALL function as before

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the calendar to use modern Svelte 5 patterns consistently, so that the codebase follows current best practices and is future-proof.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL use Svelte 5 runes ($state, $derived, $effect) instead of legacy patterns
2. WHEN props are defined THEN they SHALL use the new $props() syntax
3. WHEN events are handled THEN they SHALL use modern event handling patterns
4. WHEN component composition is needed THEN it SHALL use snippets and slots appropriately
