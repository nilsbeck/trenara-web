# Requirements Document: Remove Axios Client

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for removing the axios HTTP client from the Trenara web application and replacing it with SvelteKit's native fetch API, while preserving all existing functionality, especially the automatic token refresh mechanism that keeps users logged in.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: HTTP Client Replacement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use SvelteKit's native fetch API instead of axios, so that I can reduce bundle size and eliminate external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making HTTP requests THEN the system SHALL use native fetch API instead of axios
2. WHEN making requests THEN the system SHALL maintain the same request/response interface as the current axios implementation
3. WHEN the axios library is removed THEN the application SHALL continue to function identically
4. WHEN building the application THEN the bundle size SHALL be reduced by removing the axios dependency

### Requirement 2: Automatic Token Refresh Preservation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to remain logged in automatically without manual intervention, so that I never experience unexpected logouts during normal usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API request returns a 401 Unauthorized status THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to refresh the access token
2. WHEN token refresh is successful THEN the system SHALL retry the original request with the new token
3. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the login page
4. WHEN multiple requests fail simultaneously THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate refresh attempts
5. WHEN a user is actively using the application THEN their session SHALL be maintained indefinitely through automatic token refresh
6. WHEN the refresh token expires THEN the user SHALL be logged out gracefully

### Requirement 3: Cookie-Based Authentication Preservation

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication state to be maintained securely through HTTP-only cookies, so that my session is protected from XSS attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making authenticated requests THEN the system SHALL automatically include authentication cookies
2. WHEN tokens are refreshed THEN new tokens SHALL be stored in HTTP-only cookies
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN all authentication cookies SHALL be cleared
4. WHEN cookies expire THEN the system SHALL handle the expiration gracefully

### Requirement 4: Error Handling Preservation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive appropriate error messages when API requests fail, so that I understand what went wrong and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully
3. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL log appropriate details for debugging
4. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL display field-specific error messages

### Requirement 5: Request/Response Interceptor Functionality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain centralized request and response processing, so that cross-cutting concerns like authentication and error handling are handled consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making requests THEN the system SHALL automatically add required headers
2. WHEN receiving responses THEN the system SHALL process them through centralized error handling
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL automatically include Bearer tokens
4. WHEN requests need common configuration THEN the system SHALL apply it consistently

### Requirement 6: API Interface Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API interface to remain unchanged, so that existing code continues to work without modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling API methods THEN the function signatures SHALL remain identical
2. WHEN receiving API responses THEN the data structure SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN handling errors THEN the error format SHALL remain consistent
4. WHEN using the API client THEN the public interface SHALL be preserved

### Requirement 7: Server-Side Request Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want server-side API requests to work correctly with SvelteKit's server context, so that SSR and API routes function properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making server-side requests THEN cookies SHALL be forwarded correctly
2. WHEN handling server-side authentication THEN the system SHALL work with SvelteKit's cookie handling
3. WHEN server-side requests fail THEN errors SHALL be handled appropriately for the server context
4. WHEN using API routes THEN the fetch implementation SHALL work correctly

### Requirement 8: Performance and Bundle Size

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load faster and use less bandwidth, so that I have a better user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the bundle size SHALL be smaller than with axios
2. WHEN making HTTP requests THEN performance SHALL be equal to or better than axios
3. WHEN the application starts THEN initialization time SHALL not increase
4. WHEN using the native fetch API THEN memory usage SHALL be optimized

### Requirement 9: Development Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain good debugging and development experience, so that I can efficiently troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debugging requests THEN network inspection SHALL work correctly
2. WHEN errors occur THEN stack traces SHALL be meaningful
3. WHEN developing THEN TypeScript support SHALL be maintained
4. WHEN testing THEN the API client SHALL be easily mockable

### Requirement 10: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want existing API usage to continue working, so that I don't need to update all existing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing API calls are made THEN they SHALL work without modification
2. WHEN error handling is used THEN existing error handling code SHALL continue to work
3. WHEN authentication flows are used THEN they SHALL work identically
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN no breaking changes SHALL be introduced
